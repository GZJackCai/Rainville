Noise Masking

Your worst enemy can sometimes also be your best friend. The noises you will find here are of the second league, and will help you in masking noise you don't want to hear. Some people find it impossible to read, study, work, or do pretty much anything in the presence of undesired noise. Noise blockers usually use white noise, a continuum of frequencies equally distributed over the whole hearing range, which will mask the other noises in the room. This website introduces the concept of frequency-shaped noises, focusing on the frequencies one wants to effectively block. This ensures higher efficiency, and quieter masking levels.


At the Office

Open offices can be either too quiet or too noisy. In one situation, the slightest sound becomes distracting; in the other, ambient noise makes it impossible to concentrate. Open offices often benefit from sound masking devices, as the added noise covers existing sounds in the area, making workers less distracted and more productive.
On another issue, private offices often appear to provide privacy but are poor performers in terms of acoustics. Sound masking between adjacent offices can be used to ensure that confidential conversations remain confidential. Either the masking sound is played inside the room where privacy should be guaranteed, or on the outside, depending on the application. For example, a doctor who does not want those in the waiting room to overhear a private conversation with a patient, will provide sound masking in the waiting area, not in his office.


Tinnitus

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of any external stimulus, such as a ringing or buzzing in your ears. The most effective treatment for tinnitus is to eliminate the underlying cause. Unfortunately, in many cases, the cause of tinnitus remains unidentified. External sound sources will help you reduce your tinnitus awareness. Tinnitus maskers are particular noise machines designed to cover up your tinnitus. Because our noise generators take your own hearing threshold and the nature of your tinnitus into account, we are able to generate noises with a higher efficiency, at lower levels.


Hyperacusis

Hyperacusis is the medical term used to describe abnormal discomfort caused by sounds that are tolerable to normal hearing persons. Hyperacusis is not caused by a malfunction of your ear, but your brain, which interprets quiet sounds as being uncomfortably loud. The common treatment for hyperacusis is to listen to long periods of broadband noise at a volume that is just audible, allowing your brain to re-acquire proper reference levels. Our noise generators take your own hearing sensitivities into account, and will generate quieter sounds, compared to conventional pink noise generators, with a higher efficiency.

Presbycusis
Our ability to hear relies on hair cells, small sensory cells in the inner ear. Hair cell loss results from a variety of factors including noise exposure, ageing, toxins, or infections. When hair cells are damaged, hearing loss occurs. There are no known treatments to restore hearing, because auditory hair cells do not regenerate once lost. However, as long as your hearing cells are not completely damaged - such as with presbycusis, the scientific name given to age-related hearing loss - our noise generators are able to compensate for your hearing loss, and give your brain the acoustic simulation that is missing from unprocessed sounds.


Baby Sleep


Noises and noisescapes are known to help soothe the babies to sleep, and sleep through the night. It helps parents too, when all sleep in the same room: healthy sleeping newborns can be pretty noisy as they move and make noises while they sleep. Playing some low-level noise in your bedroom will help you sleep through the wiggles and soft squeals your baby makes.


Relaxation

Sound affects many areas of the brain and has an undeniable effect on the body. A good way to test if a particular sound is relaxing to you is to check your pulse: if it slows down, then you have found the sound that is calming you. Keep listening to it and you will relax, reaching a state of increased calmness and reducing your levels of anxiety, stress, or anger.


Meditation

The idea that you should listen to music while meditating is very common. This probably comes from the fact that many alternative health practitioners play relaxing music in the background, whereas there would simply be silence or ambient background noise to accompany traditional meditation. Indeed, it is very hard to listen to music and fully concentrate on your body, as the rhythmic nature of music will impose its tempo on your body, such as your heart rate or breathing. That's the reason why natural noises such as rain, ocean, and waterfalls are often preferred during meditation. myNoise does offer tonal noisescapes as well, which offer a great source of inspiration, and drones, which are just the opposite and designed to wash your thoughts away.


Sound Therapy

Sound Therapy was common in the world of the Ancient Greeks. Pythagoreans used mathematical techniques to create harmonic structures for emotional balance, spiritual and relationship healing, and overall health. Although science and medicine evolved in the meanwhile - harmonic structures are now perfectly understood as resulting from the laws of physics - many people still rely on sounds as a natural healing method, with numerous successes and no side effects yet known. myNoise offers different tonal noises characterized by rich harmonic structures.
